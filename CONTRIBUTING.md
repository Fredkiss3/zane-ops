# Contributing to Zane

Thank you for showing an interest in contributing to Zane! All kinds of contributions are valuable to us. In this guide, we will cover how you can quickly onboard and make your first contribution.

## Submitting an issue

Before submitting a new issue, please search the [issues](https://github.com/fredkiss3/zane-ops/issues) tab. Maybe an issue or discussion already exists and might inform you of workarounds. Otherwise, you can give new information.

While we want to fix all the [issues](https://github.com/fredkiss3/zane-ops/issues), before fixing a bug we need to be able to reproduce and confirm it. Please provide us with a minimal reproduction scenario using a repository or [Gist](https://gist.github.com/). Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us the information without asking questions back & forth with additional questions like:

- 3rd-party libraries being used and their versions
- a use-case that fails

Without said minimal reproduction, we won't be able to investigate all [issues](https://github.com/fredkiss3/zane-ops/issues), and the issue might not be resolved.

You can open a new issue with this [issue form](https://github.com/fredkiss3/zane-ops/issues/new).

## 🚀 How to work on the project ?

1. First you have to clone the repository
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Fredkiss3/zane-ops.git
    ``` 

2. **Then, Install the dependencies :**

    For the backend
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual env
    python -m venv ./venv
    # activate the virtualenv
    source ./venv/bin/activate
    # Install all the packages
    pip install uv
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    For the frontend
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
    ```


3. **Start the postgres DB and redis instance :**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4. **Run migrations :**
    
    Backend 
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. **And launch the project :**

    Backend 
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    Frontend 
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

6. Configure and start caddy server : 
    Go to `/etc/hosts` and append this entry to that file : 

    ```
    127.0.0.1       zane.local 
    ```

    Then from the root folder, run :
    ```bash
    caddy run
    ```

    The API will be available at [https://zane.local](https://zane.local).

7. **Open the source code and start rocking ! 😎**

## Missing a Feature?

If a feature is missing, you can directly _request_ a new one [here](https://github.com/fredkiss3/zane-ops/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=feature_request.yml&title=%F0%9F%9A%80+Feature%3A+). You also can do the same by choosing "🚀 Feature" when raising a [New Issue](https://github.com/fredkiss3/zane-ops/issues/new/choose) on our GitHub Repository.
If you would like to _implement_ it, an issue with your proposal must be submitted first, to be sure that we can use it. Please consider the guidelines given below.

## Coding guidelines

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, please keep these rules in mind as you are working:

- All backend features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).
- Be sure to update the `requirements.txt` file if you installed new packages
- For the frontend we use [biome](https://biomejs.dev/) as our formatter, be sure to format your code before pushing your code.
