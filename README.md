## üìö Terminologies

- **Service**: A persistent, scalable component of an application that runs continuously. Services act as the unit of your application, managing HTTP requests, executing background jobs, interfacing with databases, and more.

- **CRON**: A scheduling system for executing tasks (known as CRON jobs) at specified times or intervals. There are two
  types of CRON jobs:
    - **Command CRONs**: These jobs execute specific commands or scripts at predetermined times or intervals.
    - **HTTP CRONs**: These jobs make HTTP requests to specified URLs at set times or intervals, useful for triggering
      webhooks or remote tasks.

- **Preview Deployment**: A temporary deployment of a particular version of your application for testing and review purposes before it goes live. Preview deployments facilitate quality assurance, stakeholder review, and integration testing, enabling feedback and adjustments without impacting the production environment.
